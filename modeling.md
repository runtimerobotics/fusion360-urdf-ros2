# Introduction to Fusion 360 modeling for ROS 2

In this document, we can see how to model a 2 wheel drive robot in Fusion 360 in-order to export into ROS 2 URDF.

Here is the robot model we are going to design

Here the important steps in the modeling of this robot

# 1) Setting the Design plane for export

We must follow the right-hand rule for setting the plane before starting the modeling. If we follow this, the exported URDF model will face the + X-axis.




# 2) Sketching Robot Base

# 3) Adding Wheels to the Robot base

# 4) Moving Robot to Ground Level

# 5) Assigning Joints to Wheels

# 6) Adding Lidar base and lidar to Robot

# 7) Adding Caster Wheels to the Base of the robot

# 8) Adding material type and color

# 9) Exporting to URDF
