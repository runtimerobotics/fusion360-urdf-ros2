</p>

The installation is successfull if you are seeing the script under *My Scripts*.

After installing the script, let's dive into some important design practices we have to do to make the script work.

## Important Design Practices 

Here’s a list of things you have to consider before start modelling the robot to make it work with the script:

* **Correct the Fusion 360 coordinate system**: We have to keep the right-hand-rule for the cartesian coordinate system for designing robot model to properly work with the robot model in ROS 2 URDF. 

This section describes the coordinate system used in the project.


1) **Index Finger (X-axis)**: Represents the positive direction of the X-axis; the robot model should always point to the +X direction in Fusion 360. This axis has the **length** of the robot.

2) **Thumb (Z-axis)**: Represents the positive direction of the Z-axis. This axis has the **height** of the robot.

3) **Middle Finger (Y-axis)**: Represents the positive direction of the Y-axis. This axis is the robot's **width**.

We need to follow this coordinate system to visualize and spawn the model correctly in Rviz and Gazebo in ROS 2.

In Fusion 360, the robot model and coordinate system looks like this

</p>

- **Define all robot links as Components Definitions**:
  - Ensure all robot "links" are defined as components in your model.
  - The root link has to be defined in the name of `base_link`.
  - Errors like `KeyError: base_link__1` occur if `base_link` is incorrectly assigned.

- **Joint Definition**:
  - Parent links must be set as **Component2** when defining joints, not as **Component1**.

- **Component Requirements**:
  - Components should contain **only bodies**—nested components are not supported.
  - Avoid components that have other components inside them.

Here are the components and their bodies in the ros2bot from the demos

</p>


- **URDF Export Issues**:
  - Abnormal URDF exports without error messages usually indicate joint problems—redefine the joints and try again.
  - Supported joint types: **Rigid**, **Slider**, and **Revolute**.

- **Complex Kinematic Loops and Spherical Joints**:
  - Avoid using Fusion 360’s inbuilt joint editor for positioning joints in complex kinematic loops.
  - For spherical joints:
    - Export as revolute joints and later modify them to spherical joints in the URDF.
    - This works only if the target parser/engine supports spherical joints (e.g., PyBullet).

- **Joint Alignment**:
  - Misalignments can occur during initial joint positioning in Fusion.
  - Manual adjustments can cause cascading issues with visual and collision properties.

- **Export Tips**:
  - Turn off "Capture design history" before exporting.
  - Use distinct names for components and save individual components in separate folders to prevent issues.

- **Specific Issues**:
  - Copy-paste actions can lead to problems; prefer "copy-paste new" for components.
  - Preplan component placement to avoid assembly issues.

These points cover the critical limitations and considerations when using the script for exporting URDF files from Fusion 360 models.


## Usage

### Converting Fusion 360 Model to URDF for ROS 2
After completing the CAD model in Fusion 360, Press Shift+S for opening the script box and select the *Fusion_URDF_Exporter_ROS2* script from My Scripts. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/fusion_360_steps.png" alt="Intro Screen">
</p>


* **Step 1**: It will show a welcome screen showing the basic information about the script and ask the user to proceed with conversion or not.

* **Step 2**: After pressing the *Ok* button, it will ask for the folder in which the ROS 2 package has to be created.
 

* **Step 3**: When we press the *Ok* button it will show the browse dialog and we can select a folder.  

* **Step 4**: After selecting the folder select which Gazebo version we have to go for. Here are the two option that is current available (Gazebo Harmonic or Classic). Based on the input, it will create the launch file for that. 

* **Step 5**: Once you select the Gazebo version, it will show the final message whether it is successful or not. 
It will create the ROS 2 description package after this conversion.

### Building ROS 2 Package

After creating the ROS 2 package for your robot, you can copy the ROS 2 package to your ROS 2 workspace.
If you are working in Windows 11, you can work on ROS 2 using WSL or using a virtual machine. Othervice you can reboot and 
select Ubuntu 22.04 for ROS 2 Humble/Ubuntu 24.04 for ROS 2 Jazzy.

For example, if you use *ros2bot* model from demos folder and convert to ROS 2 package, you will get a package named
*ros2bot_description*. The package is also put in the demos folder for your reference. Copy to your ROS 2 workspace

For eg. Let's ros2_ws is the name of the workspace and you copied the package to the *src* folder of the workspace.

```
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
```
After building the package, do sourcing of the workspace

```
source install/setup.bash
```
After doing the sourcing of the workspace, we can do the visualization and simulation of the robot.
### Visualizing Robot in Rviz
Here is the command to visualize the robot in Rviz

```
ros2 launch ros2bot_description display.launch.py
```
This will be showing Rviz along with *joint_state_publisher_gui* node.

### Launching Robot Simulation in Gazebo Sim
Here is the command to spawn the robot in Gazebo. The same command can be use for Gazebo Classic and Gazebo Sim.

```
ros2 launch ros2bot_description gazebo.launch.py
```
**Note**: The URDF doesn't have any Gazebo plugin or ROS 2 controllers configurations. We have to edit the package to include all the 
plugins of Gazebo.

<p align="center">

</p>

**Note: If you are using Gazebo Sim you can visualize the center of mass, collision and inertia by finding the robot name in the **Entity Tree** and right click on it. You can find an option called **View** and can able to view all these parameters.**

Here is the screenshot of these parameter of ros2bot from the demos.
