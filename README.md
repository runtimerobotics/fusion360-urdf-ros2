## Introduction
The "Autodesk Fusion 360 to URDF for ROS 2" project aims to bridge the gap between CAD modeling and robotic simulation. 
This tool allows users to convert their Autodesk Fusion 360 models into Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) files, which can be used in ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for visualization and simulation.
 
By providing a seamless workflow from design to simulation, this project enables roboticists and engineers to visualize, test, and iterate on their robot designs more efficiently. Whether you are developing a new robot or refining an existing one, this tool simplifies the process of integrating your CAD models into the ROS 2 ecosystem.

## Description
This project is an Add-In script for Autodesk Fusion 360 to export 3D models to a robot description package which contains URDF, Mesh files (.stl),
launch files for visualization and simulation etc. to make it work with ROS 2 (Tested in Jazzy and Humble)

Here are the list of features of the project

### Features
- **Seamless Conversion**: Easily convert Autodesk Fusion 360 models into URDF files compatible with ROS 2.
- **Visualization**: Visualize your robot models in Rviz, a 3D visualization tool for ROS.
- **Simulation**: Launch and test your robot simulations in Gazebo Sim, a robust robot simulation environment.
- **User-Friendly Workflow**: Provides a straightforward workflow from CAD design to robotic simulation.
- **Sample Models**: Includes instructions and examples for modeling sample robots.
- **Customization**: Supports customization of URDF files to match specific robot configurations and requirements.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation to guide users through installation, usage, and troubleshooting.

By leveraging this tool, users can bridge the gap between CAD modeling and robotic simulation, making it easier to develop and refine robotic systems within the ROS 2 ecosystem.

### System Requirements

Here is the platform we used to test this plugin.

* Windows 11 x64
* Autodesk Fusion 360 2.0.20981 x86_64


## Installation

Here are the steps to install the script in Fusion 360

* Step 1: Download repository as Zip file and extract the file to a location.

* Step 2: Open Fusion 360, and press *Shift+S*, this will show the Scripts and Add-Ins like shown below

</p>

Click on the *Green +* icon and browse the extracted script folder as shown below. 
The folder we have to browse is *Fusion_URDF_Exporter_ROS2*.

After selecting the folder, it will show the new script as *Fusion_URDF_Exporter_ROS2* under *My Scripts*.

* Step 3: Press Shift+S to see the *Scripts and Add-Ins Window* (Utilities -> ADD-INS)
